																		{  Determine the architecture }


1.	Identify the business requirements: Before you start designing the architecture, it is important to have a clear understanding of the business requirements for your backend system. This includes the functional and non-functional requirements, such as performance, scalability, and security.

2.	Decide on the microservices: Once you have a clear understanding of the business requirements, you can start deciding on the microservices you will use. Each microservice should be focused on a specific functionality or business domain and should be designed to be autonomous and loosely coupled.

3.	the communication mechanism: The microservices in your backend system will need to communicate with each other to exchange data and information with the help of REST API 

4.	Decide on the database strategy.
